1. We have templates: CT and its corresponding locations mask located at /mritemplate/NONLINREGTOCT/warped_mov_mri_region*.: Done
2. Display the masks overlayed on template CT just to check.: Will do it later.
3. Register the template CT to a SESSION's scan CT : Linear registration and then deepreg registration. Get the linear and deepreg registration matrix.
4. Apply those linear and deepreg registration matrix on the masks. and get the registered mask files
5. Get the infarct mask from Yasheng's algorithm. Find the intersection of the infarct mask and the masks from different regions. Make a table : Name the regions as numbers 1,2,3,4,5 etc. , The columns of the table will be like region_1,region_2 etc. fill each column for its volume in that  CT scan. 
6. Keep MLS,CED,NIHSS and other scoring system as the Y-variable. Then Fit a linear model with the volumes as x-variables and find the significance of the linear equation.
